    "- billions of connected **computing devices**:\n",
    "    - **host** is the term used to descride end-users, end-machines, and end-systems, and other edge cases.\n",
    "        - are sometimes further divided into two categories: clients and servers. \n",
    "        - \n",
    "    - a ***host*** can also be considered as an app running on the network\n",
    "    \n",
    "- cables, signals, satellites, and **communication**:\n",
    "    - fiber, copper, radio, satellite\n",
    "    - transmission rate: *bandwidth*\n",
    "    \n",
    "- data transmission sent from router to client through **packet switching** while computers communicate through **circuit switching** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Interconnected ISPs make up a **network of networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tranmission Control Protocol (TCP), Internet Service Providers (ISP), Hypertext Trasfer Protocol (HTTP), 802.11 are what is considered **protocols** control for sending and receiving of messages\n",
    "\n",
    "- With all good features, there must be **internet standards** which include:\n",
    "    - RFC: Request for comments\n",
    "    - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **infrastructure** that provides serives to applications: \n",
    "    - Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, social nets, ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "- These service can provide you with a programming interface to/for apps (APIs)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - a socket interface that specifies how a program funning on one end system asks the internet infrastrucutre to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.\n",
    "        - \n",
    "    - hooks that allow sending and receiving app programs to \"connect\" to internet\n",
    "    - provides service options, analogous to postal service\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Protocols: (CrashCart Course)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **network protocols** are how machines rather than humans\n",
    "- all communication activity in Internet governed by protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "**protocols** define the **format** and **order** of the **messages sent and received** among network machines, and **action taken** on message transmission, \n",
    "\n",
    "Protocol layers are implemented in software, in hardware, or in a combination of the two. Application-layer protocols - such as HTTP and SMTP - are almost always implemented in softwre in the end systems; so are transport-layer protocols... \n",
    "\n",
    "    - the physical layer and data link layers are responsible for handling commincation over a specific link, they are typically implemented in a network interface card associated with a given link. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access network, ISPs, IXPs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **internet exchange point**: \n",

    "        - mesh of interconnected routers\n",
    "        - packet-switching: broken application-layer messages called packets\n",
    "        - forward mechanism help routers communicate across links on path from source to destination\n",
    "        - each packet transmitted at full link capacity\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Access Networks:\n",
    "- Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)\n",
    "    - old telephone lines; can transmit voice, data transmitted at different frequencies over **dedicated** line to central office\n",
    "    - DSLam (access multiplexer)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packet Switching, Store and forward mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hosts**: sending function\n",
    "    - takes a message, breaks into smaller chunks and into ***packets*** (of length L)\n",
    "    - transmits packets into access network at **transmission rate R**\n",
    "        - link transmission rate, aka link ***capacity, aka link bandwidth***\n",

    "#### Store-and-Forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tranmission rate will be determined by $\\frac{L}{R}$ seconds to transmit (push out) *L*-bit packet into link at *R* bps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Store and Forward**: the entire packet must be received at one router location before it will begin the forwarding operation to the next.\n",
    "    - there will be an end to end delay = $\\frac{2L}{R}$ (assuming zero propagation delay)\n",
    "    - Queuing and Data Loss is caused by high transmission frequencies over time\n",
    "        - packets queue, wait to be transmitted\n",
    "        - packets are dropped if memory buffer fills\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circuit Switching, FDM, TDM:\n",
    "- **frequency division multiplexer**: different channels transmitted in different frequency bands\n",
    "    - handles the data transfered over the ***shared*** cable network\n",

    "Considering transferring a large file from Host A to Host B across a computer network. This transfer might be, a video from peer to peer to another in a P2P file sharing system. The **instantaneous throughput** at any instant of time is the rate (in bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file consists of *F* bits and transfer takes *T* seconds for Host B to receive all *F* bits, then **average throughput** of the file. Transfer is *F/T* bits/sec. \n",
