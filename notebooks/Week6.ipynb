    "\n",
    "One way to identify host on the internet is to assign it a **hostname**. Hostnames are mnemonic and are therfore appreciated by humans. These names provide little to no information, about the location within the internet of hosts; hostnames can consist of variable-length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers. For this reason, hosts are also identified by **IP addresses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### IP addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "These address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchiacal structure. An IP address look likes *121.7.106.83*, where each period separates one on the bytes expresed in deciall notation from 0 to 255. The address is scanned from left to right, to obtain more and more specific information about where the host is located in the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4.1 Services Provided by DNS\n",
    "\n",
    "The main task of the Internet's **domain name system (DNS)**:\n",
    "1. a distribute database implemented in a hierarchcy of **DNS servers**\n",
    "2. an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database.\n",
    "The DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses prot 53.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols\n",
    "- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)\n",
    "- SMTP (Small Mail Transfer Protocol)\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example:\n",
    "1. The same user machine runs the lient side of the DNS application.\n",
    "2. The browser extracts the hostname, ```www.someschool.edu```, from the URL and passes the hostname to the client side of the DNS application\n",
    "3. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server.\n",
    "4. The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname. \n",
    "5. Once the browser recieves the IP address from DNS, it can intitiate a TCP connection to the HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important DNS services in addition to trasnlating hostnames to IP addresses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Host aliasing**: A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names. A hostname such as ```relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com``` could have, two or more aliases such as ***enterprise.com*** and ***www.enterprise.com***. In this case, the hostname ```relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com``` is said to be a ***canonical hostname***. Alias hostnames, when present, are more mnemonic than canonical hostnames. DNS can be invoked by an application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mail server aliasing**:  E-mail addressess be mnemonic. It is not as simple as using '**@yahoo.com**\\', the canonical hostname might be something like ```relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com```. DNS can be invoked by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostnames as well as the IP address of the host. Mail Exchange (MX) permits a company's mail server and Web server to have identical (aliased) hostnames.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Load distribution**: DNS is also used to perfom load distribution among replicated servers, such as replicated Web server, are replicated over multiple servers, with each server running on a different end system and each having a different IP address. For replicated Web servers, a *set* of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname. The DNS database contains this set of IP addresses. The the clients makes a DNS query request for a name mapped to a set of addressess within each reply. A client typically sends its HTTP request message to the IP address that is liested first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated servers. DNS rotations is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias name. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DNS is specified in [RFC 1034](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1034), and [RFC 1035](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1035), only a few things are mentioned:\n",

    "*DNS: Critical Network Functions via The Client-Server Paradigm*\n",
    "\n",
    "Life HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, the DNS protocol is an application-layer protocol since it (1) runs between communicating end systems using the client-server paradigm and (2) relies on an underlying end-to-end transport protocol to transfer DNS messages between communicating end systems. In another sense, however, the role of the DNS is quite different from Web, file transfer, and e-mail applications. Unlike these applications, the DNS is not an applications, the DNS is not an application with which a user directly interacts. Instead, the DNS provides a core Internet function - namely, translating hostnames to their underlying IP aaffresses, for user applications and other software on the internet. Much of the complexity of the Internet architecture is located at the \"edges\" of the network. The DNS, which implements the critical name-to-address translation process using clients and servers located at the edge of the network, is yet another example of that design philosophy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will provide a nice description of the what and why of DNS.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4.2 - Overview of How DNS works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple DNS design would have one DNS server that contains all the mapping. In this centrailized design, clients simply direct all queries to the single DNS server, and the DNS server responds directly to the querying clients. Althoughh the simplicity of this design is attractive, it is inappropriate for today's internet, with its vast (and growing) number of hosts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problems of centralized design include:\n",
    "- **A single point of failure**: if the DNS server crashes, so does the entire Internet\n",
    "- **Traffic volume**: a single DNS server would have to handle all DNS queries (for all the HTTP requests and email messages generated from hundreds of millions of hosts.)\n",
    "- **Distant centralized database**: A single DNS server cannot be \"close to' all the querying clients. This may cas significant delays.\n",
    "- **Maintenance**: the single DNS server would have to keep records for all internet hosts. Not only would this centralized database be huge, but it would have to be updated frequently to account for every new host.\n",
    "\n",
    "A centralized database in a single DNS server simply *doesn't scale*. Consequently, the DNS is distributed by desgin. In fact, the DNS is a wonderful example of how a distributed database can be implemented in the Internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### A Distributed, Hierarchical Database:\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with the issues of scale, the DNS uses a large number of servers. They are organized in a hierarchical fashion, and distributes information accordingly. No DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the internet. Mapping is distributed across the DNS servers. To a first approximation, there are three classes of DNS servers.\n",
    "- Root DNS servers\n",
    "- Top - Level domain (TLD) DNS servers\n",
    "- Authoritative DNS servers\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./screenshots/heir-dns.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Approximation, the following events will take place. The client first contacts one of the root servers, which returns IP addressess for TLD servers for the top-level domains. The client then contacts one of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for a website. Finally, the client contacts one of the authoritative servers for the website, which returns the IP address for the hostname website. Soon the examine this DNS lookup process in more detail. Let's take a look at the three classes of DNS servers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root DNS servers**: There are over 400 root name servers scattered all over the worl. These root names servers are managed by 13 different organizations. The full list of root name servers, along with the organizations that manage them and their IP addresses can be found at [Root Servers 2016](). Root name servers provide the IP addresses of the TLD servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top-level domain (TLD) servers**: For each of the top-level domains - top-level domains such as uk,fr,ca, and jp - com,org,net edu,and gov are all TLD server (or server cluster). \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Authoritative DNS servers**: Every organization with publicly accessible hosts (such as Web servers and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses. An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these records; alternatively, the organization an pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS serveer of some service provider. Most universities and large companies implement and maintain their own primary and secondary (backup) authoritative DNS server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The root, TLD and authoritative DNS servers all belong to the hierarchy of DNS servers. There is another important typoe of DNS server called the **local DNS server**. A local DNS server does not strictly belong to the hierarchy of servers but is nevertheless central to the DNS architecture. Each ISP - such as a residential ISP or an institutional ISP - has a local DNS server (also called a default name server). When a host connects to an ISP provides the host with the IP address of your local DNS server by accessing network status windows in Windowns or UNIX. A host's local DNS server is typically \"close to\" the host. For an institutional ISP, the local DNS server may be on the same LAN as the host; for a residential ISP, it is typically seperated from the host by no more than a few routers. When a host makes a DNS query, the query is sent to the local DNS server, which acts a proxy, forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking a look at a simple example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose \n",
    "\n",
    "```cse.nyu.edu``` desire the IP address of ```gaia.cs.umass.edu```, and suppose that NYU's ocal DNS server ```cse.nyu.edu``` is called ```dns.nyu,edu``` and that an authoritative DNS server for ``` gaia.cs.umass.edu``` is called ```dns.umass.edu```. As shown below, the host ```cse.nyu.edu``` first sends a DNS query message to its local DNS server, ```dns.nyu.edu```. The query message contains the hostname to be translated, namely, ```gaia.cs.umass.edu```. The local DNS server forwards the query message to a root DNS server. The root DNS server takes note of the edu suffix and returns to the local DNS server a list of IP addresses for TLD servers responsible of *edu*. The local DNS server then resends the query message to one of these TLD servers. The TLD server takes note of the ```umass.edu``` suffix and responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the University of Massachusetts, namely, ```dns.umass.edu```. Finally, the local DNS server resends the query message directly to ```dns.umass.edu```, which responds with the IP address of ```gaia.cs.umass.edu```. Note that in this example, in order to obtain the mapping for one hostname, eight DNS messages were sent: four query messages and four reply messages!We'll soon see how DNS caching reduces this query traffic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our previous example assumed that the TLD server knows the authoritative DNS server for the hostname. In general this not always true. Instead, the TLD server:\n",
